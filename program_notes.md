To do:
[x] add tenth and final frame Not working still - potentially set up tests to testdrive this?
[x] add summary of game working well!
[x] abstract more stuff into methods x 
[ ] test drive at least one feature with mocks
[x] Find fun messages to throw after strikes x but get more
[] Refactor the get final frame code, it's ugly
